# Iris-Dataset-Correlation-Linear-Regression-Analysis

This project explores the classic Iris dataset using statistical techniques and linear regression modeling. The focus is on analyzing relationships between flower measurements (sepal length, petal length, petal width) through Pearson correlation and constructing simple linear regression models to predict petal width.

Key tasks include:

📊 Calculating Pearson correlation coefficients between selected feature pairs

📈 Building two linear regression models with different independent variables

🔍 Comparing model performance using R-squared values

🧠 Gaining insights into variable relationships and model quality of fit

This repository serves as a hands-on project for applying data analysis, regression techniques, and statistical reasoning in Python (or R) on one of the most famous datasets in machine learning.
